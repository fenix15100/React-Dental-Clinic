Small application developed in React, which "allows" to manage the appointments of a dental clinic, Class components, Stateless Components, Bootstrap,LifeCycleMethods and LocalStorage are used.
This app belongs to my humble Front-End development portfolio.
This is the first portfolio project and is very simple.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
